## 🧠 How It Works

1. **User Registration:**  
   New users can sign up via the registration page (`registration.html`), which stores details and performs basic validation.

2. **Login:**  
   Existing users can log in through `login.html` using credentials verified on the client side.

3. **Issue Submission:**  
   Once logged in, users can go to `RegisterIssue.html` to submit issues with details such as title, description, and category.

4. **Navigation:**  
   The website provides smooth navigation between Home, About, Login, and Issue Reporting pages.
